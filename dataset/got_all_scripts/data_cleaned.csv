You are the bastard, though.', 'And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not.

I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.', ""Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities.

Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."", ""Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how?

I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice."", 'You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.', 'I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.', ""Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.

You said we were riding for Winterfell."", ""Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"", 'Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.', ""Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"", ""She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."", ""Neither am I!

Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.', ""Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"", ""Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."", 'Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.', 'Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.', ""Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"", 'Confessing my crimes.', ""Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."", ""Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."", 'I understand the law.', 'No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.', 'Agreed.', 'Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.', ""I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."", ""Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."", 'Do I have a volunteer?', 'Anyone?... Anyone?', 'Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.', 'A Lannister always pays his debts.', 'From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.', 'And feed it to the goats, yes.', 'Uncle. Father.', 'Sorry to disappoint you.', 'May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.', 'We have our differences, Jaime and I.', 'And the Starks? Lord Eddard?', 'How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?', 'My sister rules, you mean.', 'Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.', ""Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."", 'Shagga likes axes.', 'The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?', ""Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."", 'Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.', ""lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."", 'Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?', 'Took her? From whom?', ""And he didn't have anything to say about it?"", ""Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."", 'Who are you?', 'What did your mother call you?', 'My mother died giving birth to me.', 'What sort of accent is that?', 'For-', ""What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."", ""One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."", 'And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?', 'No.', 'Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?', ""Let's play a new game."", 'Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?', ""No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."", 'l happen to be a great judge of character.', ""lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."", 'Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.', 'You killed your first man before you were 12.', ""You've been north of the Wall."", ""And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."", ""lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore."", 'All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.', ""And we've established the rules about lying?"", 'You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.', ""So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"", 'Are you sure –', 'My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.', 'Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.', ""That's not how the game works."", 'How did you hear that?', 'Another night, perhaps.', ""lt's not a pleasant story."", ""So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."", ""lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."", 'Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.', 'Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.', 'As l said, l was young and stupid.', 'What is it? What do you want?', 'What?', 'Get my squire!', 'lf l die, weep for me.', ""l'll know."", 'Stay low?', 'l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!', 'To battle!', ""l'm alive?"", 'Did we win?', 'How did our tribesmen do?', ""lt's nice to see them getting along."", 'Good of you to notice. l hear we won.', 'Did we get the Stark boy, at least?', 'Where was he?', 'And where are they?', ""The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped."", ""There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed."", ""Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."", 'And do what?', 'Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?', 'So it would seem.', ""No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."", 'What?', 'l believe he used the word ""whore"".', ""My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"", 'Beloved nephew.', 'We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.', ""What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."", ""Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."", 'But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.', 'Of course you are.', 'Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.', ""Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."", ""It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."", 'Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.', 'Yes, but in his absence…', ""If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."", ""Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us."", 'Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.', ""Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?"", 'Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.', 'Joffrey is King.', ""I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."", ""You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them."", 'One?', ""Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."", 'A bit corpsey, yes.', 'I thought you wanted to come here.', 'You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?', 'You can smell cum from the balcony?', 'And so did the country.', ""Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."", ""You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."", ""Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth."", ""Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."", ""Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."", 'You brought this on yourself.', ""Do you understand we're losing the war?"", 'It was quite a battle.', 'Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.', ""Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. ."", 'Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.', ""I don't like threats."", ""I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played."", 'And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.', ""You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."", 'Safe travels, cousin.', 'You have a deft hand with diplomacy.', 'Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.', 'Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.', ""According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."", 'Apparently you burn him.', ""I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."", 'Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.', 'Myself, I prefer the improper ones.', 'You know your wines, my lord.', ""Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."", 'Wars have been started for less.', ""I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night."", ""Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."", ""Quite right. Especially the queen's orders."", ""No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."", ""You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister."", ""That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."", 'I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.', 'The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.', ""I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."", ""Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."", ""I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."", ""The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend."", ""No, we shan't."", ""There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."", 'His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.', 'To the new Commander.', ""If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"", ""I have every right. I am the King's Hand."", ""Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"", ""You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."", ""It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."", ""I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."", 'As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.', 'She was my mother too.', 'Keep your voice down.', ""I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens."", 'Again, only temporary.', ""But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion."", 'Kitchen wench.', 'Yes, but-', ""Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find.

I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side."", 'Please.', 'I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?', 'These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.', ""I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."", ""I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.

Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships."", 'But remember, you must tell no one.', 'I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.', ""For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"", 'Who better?', 'The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.', ""Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."", 'You served my family well in the matter of the succession.', ""I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"", 'Good. Oh. And remember-', ""Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this."", 'Dorne is the safest place for her.', ""That's why we need to seduce them.

Sorry about that.', 'Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.', ""Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."", ""No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"", 'Find him?', ""No, you don't."", 'You disappoint me, Grand Maester.', 'So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.', 'See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.

She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?', ""For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."", 'The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?', ""I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat.

There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn\'t understand. But he wasn\'t mindless. He had his reasons.

I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn\'t watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson\'s beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn\'t figure out why he was doing it.

Let's call a truce."", 'I trust you.', ""There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?"", ""The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"", ""First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."", 'Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?', 'Jaime. My name is Jaime.', ""You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"", 'We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.', 'It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.', ""He'll make time for you."", 'Shall we drink on it?', 'You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?', 'Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.', ""I'm afraid I must insist."", 'Tomorrow.', ""Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.

I swear it.', 'My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.', ""Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards."", ""What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?"", ""Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."", ""You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle."", 'So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?', 'What is?', 'You performed experiments on living men.', 'With their permission?', 'Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain.

Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."", 'Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.', 'Whoa.', 'Be quiet.', 'A wooden sword?', 'You gave her a wooden sword.', ""I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.

I don't want children."", 'Supper would be nice.', 'I suppose you want the sword back.', ""You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."", 'Days?', 'Uh... a hook would be more practical.', 'Odd little man.', 'What symptoms?', 'You let him touch you?', ""I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you."", ""I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat."", 'You drink more than you used to.', 'Why?', 'It must have been traumatic for you.', 'A rather short siege.', 'Father disowned me today.', ""You're forgetting Tyrion."", 'Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.', ""I want...

He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed.
