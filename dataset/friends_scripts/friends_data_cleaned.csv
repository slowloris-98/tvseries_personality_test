You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.', ""Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something."", ""Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it."", ""Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you."", ""Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"", 'Really?', 'Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!', ""What?

I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?"", 'What?!', 'Okay. Okay.', ' Hi!', 'Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.', 'That yeti is one smooth talker.', ""Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."", ""Come on you guys!

Settle down."", ""I haven't seen him in so long!"", 'Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?', 'Thank you.  Mon?', ""How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff."", ""Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced."", ""I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."", 'Hi Danny!  Wow! Thirsty huh?', 'Ohh, great!', 'Yeah.', "" Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out."", ""That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control!

There is no ball.', ""Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala."", 'What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!', ""Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!"", ""No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy."", 'Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.', ""Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."", 'Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?', ""Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!"", 'Oh, go on!

He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!"", 'What?!', 'Okay, that we may be able to do.', ""Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex."", ""Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are."", 'Yeah.', 'Then, you will definitely get him back!', ""Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on."", 'Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek!

I mean, I could, but I wouldnt.', 'That wouldnt help me.', 'Kim, hi.', 'Okay..Okay.. Look. Im sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.', ' Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I cant do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I cant do this.

I wanna marry this plan!', 'So, if I wanna have my kid when Im 35, I dont have to get pregnant until Im 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes!

How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?', 'Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?

Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! "", 'Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.', ""Oh, it is so unfair.

When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?', 'No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...', ""Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."", 'Right, totally.', ""Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex."", ""I know.

Have you?"", ""Of course, I'd be honored!"", ""OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex..."", 'Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh!  Wow! You remember Joey?', 'So now, what are you doing here?', ' Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!', ""Oh, I know, isn't she?"", ""All right. What's your news, Amy?"", 'What? Oh my God! To who?', 'A-And??', ""No, what's he like?"", 'Yeah.', ""Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."", 'Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...', 'Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didnt love. Do you remember Barry?', 'Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made. Honey, you deserve   true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere.

I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me."", ""Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I dont think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnt for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know its gonna take patience, but thats ok."", 'Amy, thats what I was supposed to wear today, thats why I hung it on the door.', ""Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."", 'Well, what happened?', 'Oh, that is so tacky.', 'Phoebe, thats huge!', 'I think it could be kind of great!', "" Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!"", 'Menstrual cramps.', ' Can any of you watch Emma?', ' Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?', ' Well, actually... ', 'Yeah.', 'Why not?', ' Wha... the next one?', 'Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her!

Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?  "", 'Oh!', ""Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?"", 'Hi!', ""I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in."", ""Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys."", ""Who's Gladys?"", ' Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous!', 'Well, I mean, sure, of course.

Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. Youre probably just gonna catch her just as shes about to go to the gate. Youre gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!""

It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"", ""Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.

Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."", ""Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."", 'You know what? I take back what I said before.

I'm thinking of getting me one of those."", 'Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great', 'is because they were friends first. Y\'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So', ""I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch."", ""I'll treat you real nice. "", ""Won't-won't that take longer?"", 'Yeah. I understand. I understand.

It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her', ""Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad."", ""That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"", 'I look more like him than you do! ', "" Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."", ' Yeah I did!', ""Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so"", 'Who knows?', ""Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!"", 'Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.', 'Hey Pheebs!  Hey!', ""Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."", ""Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."", ""That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!"", ""I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!"", ""What? Chandler! Tell 'em!"", 'At least I care about his feelings!', 'Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?', 'Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!', 'You just give him a spoon baby!', 'Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!', ""Yeah?! So's yours!"", 'Oh yeah, no problem.', "" Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."", ' Ross!', 'Hi!', 'Uh-oh.', ""Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup."", 'Oh, what did I say?', ""How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!"", 'Hmm, noodle soup.', 'Okay.', 'Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!', 'Hey.', 'Yeah right! ', 'Yeah? Well look Ross, you don\'t have to. Okay? It\'s not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can\'t even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."" ', 'What you do mean?', 'Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.', ""Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor"", ""No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed."", 'Thank you! So, did-did he get it?', 'Eh, what are you gonna do?', "" Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!"", ""Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."", ""She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.

It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out."", ' Oh, they cut me out of the show.', "" Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there"", "" I'm in it."", "" I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died."", ""Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
