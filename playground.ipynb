I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle\\'s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake.

You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.\\', \"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don\\'t believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what\\'s a lowborn girl to do?\", \\'Are you sure –\\', \\'My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.\\', \\'Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.\\', \"That\\'s not how the game works.\", \\'How did you hear that?\\', \\'Another night, perhaps.\\', \"lt\\'s not a pleasant story.\", \"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright\\'s orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.\", \"lt didn\\'t last long. l didn\\'t know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.\", \\'Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.\\', \\'Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.\\', \\'As l said, l was young and stupid.\\', \\'What is it? What do you want?\\', \\'What?\\', \\'Get my squire!\\', \\'lf l die, weep for me.\\', \"l\\'ll know.\", \\'Stay low?\\', \\'l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!\\', \\'To battle!\\', \"l\\'m alive?\", \\'Did we win?\\', \\'How did our tribesmen do?\\', \"lt\\'s nice to see them getting along.\", \\'Good of you to notice. l hear we won.\\', \\'Did we get the Stark boy, at least?\\', \\'Where was he?\\', \\'And where are they?\\', \"The Stark boy appears to be less green than we\\'d hoped.\", \"There\\'s your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark\\'s head. You\\'ll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He\\'s winning – in case you hadn\\'t noticed.\", \"Half wrong. l\\'m new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can\\'t stay here.\", \\'And do what?\\', \\'Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?\\', \\'So it would seem.\\', \"No, he said l couldn\\'t take with me to King\\'s Landing. He was very specific on that point.\", \\'What?\\', \\'l believe he used the word \"whore\".\\', \"My father\\'s probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He\\'s always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don\\'t you come with me, be the Hando s lady?

More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you\\'re going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn\\'t like me.\", \"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I\\'m sorry for your loss.\", \\'But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.\\', \\'Of course you are.\\', \\'Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.\\', \"Don\\'t get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.\", \"It\\'s been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.\", \\'Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.\\', \\'Yes, but in his absence…\\', \"If I were capable of tricking father, I\\'d be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .\", \"Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark\\'s head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.\", \\'Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.\\', \"Who\\'s won every battle he\\'s fought. Do you understand we\\'re losing the war?\", \\'Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.\\', \\'Joffrey is King.\\', \"I\\'m only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.\", \"You love your children. It\\'s your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.\", \\'One?\\', \"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one\\'s head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.\", \\'A bit corpsey, yes.\\', \\'I thought you wanted to come here.\\', \\'You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?\\', \\'You can smell cum from the balcony?\\', \\'And so did the country.\\', \"Yes, well, you need to be careful.

I\\'m a slave to the truth.\", \"Why do you think I am so little? I\\'m being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.\", \"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn\\'t suffer enough. One of the many changes we\\'ll have to make around here.\", \\'You brought this on yourself.\\', \"Do you understand we\\'re losing the war?\", \\'It was quite a battle.\\', \\'Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.\\', \"Men like Lord Varys and I can\\'t let our disadvantages get the best of us. We\\'ll make a fisherman of him yet. .\", \\'Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.\\', \"I don\\'t like threats.\", \"I\\'m not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.\", \\'And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.\\', \"You\\'ve perfected the art of tearing up papers.

Mormont doesn\\'t lie.\", \\'Apparently you burn him.\\', \"I don\\'t know what I believe, but here\\'s a fact for you. The Night\\'s Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.\", \\'Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.\\', \\'Myself, I prefer the improper ones.\\', \\'You know your wines, my lord.\\', \"Call me Tyrion, please. I\\'m sure you\\'re getting used to fine dinners, now that you\\'re a lord.\", \\'Wars have been started for less.\\', \"I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger\\'s brothel the other night.\", \"Yes, of course.

Especially the queen\\'s orders.\", \"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert\\'s bastards? She\\'s always been a jealous woman.\", \"You\\'ve heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.\", \"That\\'s good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert\\'s bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei\\'s children.\", \\'I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.\\', \\'The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.\\', \"I\\'m not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I\\'m denying its existence.\", \"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.

He loves a good grovel.\\', \\'No, I think not.\\', \\'You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires.

Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don\\'t have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it\\'s all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.\", \"Oh, I\\'ll give her Pycelle.\", \"Yes, I\\'ll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.\", \\'Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.\\', \\'Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.\\', \"It\\'s not what Varys says. He says Renly\\'s army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.\", \\'And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.\\', \"She\\'ll be safer in Dorne.\", \"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don\\'t blame her at all for you.\", \\'Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us.

Enough. Even torturing you is boring.

What do we have?\\', \"Well, I\\'ve never actually been able to kill people with it.\", \"He hasn\\'t sent a raven in weeks. He\\'s very busy.

What did you tell him?\\', \\'Are you going to accept their offer?\\', \"Testifying against me wasn\\'t a suggestion. If they can\\'t tempt you with honey, they\\'ll choose something less sweet.\", \"Pod, the trial\\'s in a fortnight. They\\'ll want an answer before that.\", \"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner\\'s block, I don\\'t want to see your head already mounted.\", \"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King\\'s Landing before it\\'s too late. Pod! This is farewell.\", \\'Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.\\', \\'Is that supposed to make me feel better?\\', \"It\\'s complicated, yes. So how is our sister?\", \\'Her son?\\', \"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I\\'m guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she\\'s probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.\", \\'So, should I turn around and close my eyes?\\', \"The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You\\'re really asking if I killed your son?\", \\'Well, you could set me free.\\', \"Then there\\'s really nothing else to say.\", \"Sorry, I\\'d forgotten. I\\'d hate for you to do something inappropriate.\", \"Except I didn\\'t do it.\", \"Sansa couldn\\'t have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it\\'s a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?\", \"No, but... Sansa\\'s not a killer. Not yet, anyway.\", \"Let me guess, I\\'ve been pardoned.\", \\'Really?\\', \"Well, we mustn\\'t disappoint Father.\", \\'No.\\', \\'Not that I know of.\\', \\'Choked on his pigeon pie.\\', \\'Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.\\', \"Oh, why don\\'t you tell them what Joffrey was doing?\", \\'Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.\\', \\'Father, may I ask the witness one question?\\', \\'You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?\\', \\'Not going well, is it?\\', \\'Oh, you think so?\\', \\'Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.\\', \\'How do you know?\\', \"Shae. Please don\\'t.\", \\'Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.\\', \\'I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.\\', \"Yes, Father. I\\'m guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?\", \"No, of that I\\'m innocent. I\\'m guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.\", \"Oh, yes, I am. I\\'ve been on trial for that my entire life.\", \\'Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.\\', \\'Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.\\', \\'I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.\\', \"I will not give my life for Joffrey\\'s murder. And I know I\\'ll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.\", \"I\\'m sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?\", \"Of course it\\'s a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn\\'t- I couldn\\'t listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn\\'t do it.\", \"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I\\'m innocent and he\\'s willing to sacrifice me anyway. He\\'s willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You\\'re the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you\\'ll always be the golden son.\", \\'At least I got to tell them what they really are.\\', \"Don\\'t give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren\\'t there to save me.\", \"Where\\'s your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father\\'s face when you fall.\", \\'Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.\\', \"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he\\'ll do it again. If he wins, I expect I\\'ll be in his debt for the rest of my life.\", \"Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it\\'s Ser Meryn Trant. I\\'d enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.\", \\'You have new clothes.\\', \\'I sent for you days ago.\\', \\'Doing what?\\', \"Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn\\'t strike me as your sort of girl.\", \"She\\'s dim-witted.\", \\'When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?\\', \\'And you understand the rules of inheritance?\\', \\'She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.\\', \\'You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?\\', \\'Is it two wives you want or two castles?\\', \"I\\'m a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.\", \\'You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.\\', \\'My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.\\', \\'Does he frighten you so much?\\', \"Because you\\'re my friend.\", \\'I understand.\\', \"Why are you sorry? Because you\\'re an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That\\'s what I liked about you in the first place.\", \\'Yes, we did.\\', \"I suppose I\\'ll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won\\'t that make for a great song?\", \"I imagined you\\'d be back at the brothel at this hour.\", \"Mm, do tell. I\\'ve got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.\", \\'Oh.\\', \\'Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.\\', \"She didn\\'t need to bother you. It looks as though I\\'ve taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She\\'s wanted this for a long time.\", \\'I think I would have remembered that.\\', \\'You and my family have more in common than you might admit.\\', \\'That would have made things so much easier.\\', \\'Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.\\', \"If you want justice, you\\'ve come to the wrong place.\", \"Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man\\'s guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?\", \"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don\\'t get a name like that unless you\\'re deadly, right?\", \"Oh, he\\'s going to die. I\\'m going to die.\", \"That\\'s putting it mildly. What\\'s the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?\", \"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That\\'s the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There\\'s no kind of killing that doesn\\'t have its own word.\", \"Cousins, you\\'re right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?\", \\'Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.\\', \\'Nothing made him happier.\\', \"On the contrary. Laughing at another person\\'s misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.\", \\'For you. You drifted away.\\', \\'Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.\\', \\'I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash \\\\\\'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\" I wasn\\\\\\'t deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik\\\\\\'s library.\\', \\'Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn\\\\\\'t seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson\\\\\\'s affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn\\\\\\'t understand. But he wasn\\\\\\'t mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn\\\\\\'t watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson\\\\\\'s beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn\\\\\\'t figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.\\', \\'I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.\\', \\'He just pushed me aside with a \"khuu\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?\\', \\'Looks like very light armor.\\', \"You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn\\'t drink before a fight.\", \\'It could get you killed. It could get me killed.\\', \\'Thank the gods.\\', \\'Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.\\', \"What\\'re you doing?\", \"Who\\'s helping you?\", \\'Varys?\\', \\'I suppose this is goodbye, then.\\', \\'Jaime, thank you. For my life.\\', \"I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\", \"All my life, you\\'ve wanted me dead.\", \\'I loved her.\\', \\'Shae.\\', \\'I murdered her. With my own hands.\\', \"It doesn\\'t matter?\", \\'Say that word again.\\', \"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn\\'t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?\", \"I can\\'t go back there. She\\'s in there.\", \\'I am your son. I have always been your son.\\', \"I still don\\'t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.\", \"Do you know what it\\'s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?\", \\'Pentos?\\', \\'Much better.\\', \"I don\\'t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don\\'t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.\", \\'In a box. Why stop now?\\', \\'The future is shit. Just like the past.\\', \\'Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.\\', \\'Not for a coward.\\', \\'You never told me why you set me free.\\', \\'You could have said no.\\', \"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You\\'re not family, you owe me nothing.\", \\'A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.\\', \"You\\'re going to have to find another soldier. I\\'m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.\", \"I\\'m not well-suited for work.\", \\'Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.\\', \\'What is it you want exactly?\\', \"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that\\'s how they became powerful in the first place.\", \\'I will never sit on the Iron Throne.\\', \\'Good luck finding him.\\', \\'Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?\\', \"There\\'s a bug.\", \\'When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?\\', \\'I want to take a walk.\\', \\'She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.\\', \"You\\'re right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What\\'s in Volantis?\", \\'And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?\\', \"We\\'ve already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone\\'s banner hanging from it.\", \"I didn\\'t rule. I was a servant.\", \\'Managed to kill a lot of people.\\', \"She wanted me to leave King\\'s Landing. She begged me. I wouldn\\'t go.\", \\'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.\\', \\'I find us repulsive.\\', \"You\\'re right. Let\\'s go for a walk.\", \\'How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?\\', \\'I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\\', \\'Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.\\', \"I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can\\'t remember the last face I saw that wasn\\'t yours.\", \"I\\'m losing my mind.\", \\'Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.\\', \\'Slaves.\\', \"The only red priest we had in King\\'s Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one\\'s much better looking.\", \"Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You\\'d have better luck dancing away the plague. .\", \"We\\'re going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn\\'t want to meet the Saviour?\", \"Come on. Let\\'s find a brothel.\", \"It\\'s even better luck to suck a dwarf\\'s cock.\", \\'See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.\\', \\'Curious... hair. .\\', \"It appears you\\'re not the only Targaryen supporter.\", \"Well, , she\\'s taken.\", \\'I need to speak to someone with hair.\\', \\'Hello?\\', \"You\\'ve got no drink.\", \"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I\\'m well known for it.\", \"That\\'s because they\\'ve never met a queen.\", \\'You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.\\', \\'Because you have a skeptical mind.\\', \"I\\'m, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t.\", \"I\\'m not.\", \"Gladly, but this, I can\\'t do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I\\'ll go for a piss, that\\'s a start.\", \"No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I\\'m sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.\", \"You made some kind of mistake. Why don\\'t you tell me what you think you are doing and -\", \\'Thank you. . Who are you?\\', \\'Do you have wine?\\', \"I can\\'t sleep without wine.\", \"You\\'re going the wrong way. My sister\\'s in Westeros. Westeros is west! We\\'re heading east.\", \\'You said you were taking me to the Queen.\\', \\'What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!\\', \"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you\\'ve ever met my sister, you\\'d understand. So now that it\\'s clear we\\'re on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You\\'re Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren\\'t you? It\\'s all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it\\'s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys\\'s little birds. She found out, didn\\'t she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I\\'d say the reverse is just as likely.\", \"Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be fine. Nothing broken, I don\\'t think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let\\'s start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn\\'t have to be an unpleasant trip. We\\'re going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.\", \\'What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.\\', \"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they\\'re not…\", \"I know where we are. You\\'re taking us through Valyria.\", \\'Have you sailed this route before?\\', \"You\\'re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I\\'m not enough?\", \"You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren\\'t you afraid of the Doom?\", \\'Oh.\\', \\'The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -\\', \\'And then they weren\\\\\\'t. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -\"\\', \\'I would clap.\\', \\'I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.\\', \\'What was that?\\', \\'Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!\\', \\'Mormont! Mormont!\\', \"You? . I\\'ve seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.\", \"It\\'d be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn\\'t have needed saving if you hadn\\'t kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?\", \\'Without luck?\\', \"That\\'s the best idea you\\'ve had all day.\", \"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can\\'t live on berries and roots.\", \"You\\'re not hungry?\", \"You\\'re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.\", \"We are travelling together. In each other\\'s company. Therefore…\", \"I sailed from King\\'s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.\", \\'Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.\\', \"I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn\\'t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.\", \\'As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.\\', \\'I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”\\', \"You didn\\'t know. I\\'m sorry. I am.\", \\'I only know what I heard\\', \\'He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.\\', \"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert\\'s Rebellion.\", \\'I believe in many things.\\', \\'No.\\', \"Doesn\\'t mean she\\'s going to be a great queen.\", \\'The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?\\', \"We? Alright, let\\'s assume your dreams come true. She\\'s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?\", \"So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That\\'s justice?\", \\'Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?\\', \\'Why is it anchored?\\', \"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let\\'s discuss this!\", \"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can\\'t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\", \\'Guess again.\\', \"The fighting puts in Mereen! You\\'re in luck then, you\\'re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\", \\'Him.\\', \"Sure, he\\'s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\", \\'He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\\', \\'The Kingslayer!\\', \\'Wait! You have to buy me as well.\\', \"We\\'re a team. I\\'m a great fighter, too.\", \\'Thank you my Lord. Thank you.\\', \"My Lord, if I may. I\\'ve heard Mereen\\'s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…\", \\'What are you doing?\\', \"It\\'s true. He has.\", \"I am the gift. It\\'s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.\", \\'If only I were otherwise.\\', \\'You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.\\', \"Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It\\'s too soon to know if you deserve my service.\", \\'When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.\\', \\'Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.\\', \"Killing and politics aren\\'t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.\", \\'I know.\\', \"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can\\'t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.\", \\'Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?\\', \\'And did he?\\', \\'He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.\\', \"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you\\'re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you\\'re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.\", \"Have you decided yet whether you\\'re going to have me killed?\", \"I can see why you would think so. It\\'s what your father would have done.\", \"My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I\\'d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.\", \"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I\\'ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we\\'ll need more wine than this.\", \\'So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.\\', \"I\\'ve heard stories.\", \\'To see if you were the right kind of terrible.\\', \\'The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.\\', \\'Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.\\', \"It\\'s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.\", \\'Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.\\', \"He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn\\'t have to do. I suspect he\\'s the main reason you weren\\'t slaughtered in your crib.\", \\'Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.\\', \"That\\'s the one.\", \\'Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.\\', \\'No? Banish me?\\', \"So if I\\'m not going to be murdered, and I\\'m not going to be banished...\", \\'Advise you on what?\\', \\'The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.\\', \"I\\'m not entirely joking. There\\'s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.\", \\'And when you get back to your home, who supports you?\\', \"Let\\'s be generous and assume that\\'s going to happen. Here in Slaver\\'s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won\\'t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won\\'t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.\", \"It\\'s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You\\'re not the first person to have dreamt it.\", \\'The smaller man it is.\\', \"There\\'s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.

Of course, it\\'s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.\", \"Dwarf. I believe that\\'s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.\", \\'Rusty” Thank you.\\', \"He\\'s right. The dragon headed north.

And sometimes there\\'s more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn\\'t. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you\\'re our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King\\'s daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That\\'s why she came here. And she\\'s not about to head north to fight an enemy she\\'s never seen on a word of a man she doesn\\'t know after a single meeting. That\\'s not a reasonable thing to ask.\", \\'So do you have anything reasonable to ask?\\', \"Maybe you are a northern fool. I\\'m asking if there\\'s something I can do to help you.\", \\'Yes.

The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he\\'s here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he\\'s here anyway. You don\\'t have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he\\'s wrong it\\'s worthless. You didn\\'t even know it was here. It\\'s nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.\", \"You must allow them their flights of fancy.

That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren\\'t welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn\\'t walk them through the front gates. I couldn\\'t have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.\", \\'It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.\\', \\'No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.\\', \\'As a good friend of mine once said, \"give me 10 good men and I\\\\\\'ll impregnate the bitch.\"\\', \\'And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.\\', \"But as my sister\\'s armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.

Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.\\', \"I don\\'t want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.\", \"She\\'ll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.\", \\'You spoke with her?\\', \"I\\'m about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who\\'s already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who\\'s an idiot?\", \"A foreign whore you can\\'t abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.\", \"I didn\\'t know about that.\", \"Cersei, I didn\\'t know.\", \"I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn\\'t want to debate and negotiate. She didn\\'t want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don\\'t want to destroy our family. I never have.\", \"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn\\'t commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.\", \\'I have never been more sorry about anything.\\', \\'All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.\\', \"If it weren\\'t for me, you\\'d have a motherIf it weren\\'t for me, you\\'d have a father.\", \\'I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.\\', \"I don\\'t care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there\\'s anything left of it.\", \"If there\\'s no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?\", \\'Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.\\', \\'Mm, not like this.\\', \\'Yes.\\', \\'Because I think she will make the world a better place.\\', \\'She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.\\', \"You\\'re pregnant.\", \"You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won\\'t freeze off.\", \"Because I have balls, and you don\\'t.\", \"If anyone survives the war to come, we\\'ll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.\", \"I know, I know, our people haven\\'t been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.\", \\'My lord. My lady.\\', \\'The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.\\', \"Last time we spoke was at Joffrey\\'s wedding. Miserable affair.\", \"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king\\'s murder.\", \\'Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.\\', \"I\\'m sure you weren\\'t thrilled to hear the Lannister army\\'s marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you\\'ll be safe-\", \\'She did.\\', \\'She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.\\', \\'One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.\\', \\'And our queen is grateful.\\', \"I sense that you\\'re leading to a proposal.\", \\'They do make a handsome couple.\\', \"I\\'m not that old.\", \\'Not as old as him.\\', \\'Our queen respects the wisdom of age.\\', \\'What is that?\\', \\'Your Grace, I know my brother-\\', \"He came here alone, knowing full well how he\\'d be received. Why would he do that if he weren\\'t telling the truth?\", \\'I was a fool.\\', \"I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it\\'s all over.\", \\'Well, here we are.\\', \\'Together again.\\', \\'And the masses rejoice.\\', \"She\\'s your new queen too.\", \"They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They\\'ll come around once they see Daenerys is different.\", \\'She is.\\', \\'I am.\\', \"It\\'s hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.\", \\'Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.\\', \\'Was she lying about the baby too?\\', \\'She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.\\', \"So we\\'re going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-\", \\'My cock.\\', \"At least Cersei won\\'t get to murder me. I\\'m sure I\\'ll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I\\'m being ripped apart by dead men.\", \"Maybe after I\\'m dead I\\'ll march down to King\\'s Landing and rip her apart.\", \\'How will he find you?\\', \\'When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.\\', \\'Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.\\', \\'Do you need help?\\', \"You\\'ve had a strange journey.\", \"I\\'d like to hear about it.\", \\'If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.\\', \\'I wish Father were here.\\', \\'I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.\\', \\'I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.\\', \\'You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.\\', \\'I was speaking in relative terms.\\', \\'Of course I miss it.\\', \"It\\'s not. Things would be easier if it were.\", \\'The perils of self-betterment.\\', \"To contemplate your imminent death. You\\'ve come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It\\'s not bad. It\\'s not good either.\", \\'And you?\\', \\'Ser Davos, join us.\\', \\'Would you like a drink?\\', \"It\\'s strange, isn\\'t it? Almost everyone here\\'s fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.\", \\'I think we might live.\\', \\'I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.\\', \\'Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.\\', \\'Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.\\', \\'Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!\\', \"No, let\\'s stay a bit longer.\", \\'How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?\\', \\'Ser Brienne?\\', \\'Mmm.\\', \\'If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.\\', \\'What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.\\', \\'And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...\\', \"You might be surprised at the lengths I\\'d go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.\", \\'Maybe we should have stayed married.\\', \\'What a terrifying thought.\\', \\'Why not?\\', \\'Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!\\', \\'A fitting reward for a hero.\\', \"And a Lord of Storm\\'s End who will be forever loyal to you.\", \"I\\'m sure you had your reasons.\", \\'So did you?\\', \"I don\\'t imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.\", \"Then you\\'re in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.\", \\'This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.\\', \\'You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.\\', \"You\\'re the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.\", \"You don\\'t want it.\", \\'I envy you.\\', \\'Your Grace?\\', \"There\\'s something you need to know.\", \\'Yes.\\', \\'Varys.\\', \\'He does.\\', \"I\\'m glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you\\'re facing.\", \\'Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.\\', \\'It was a mistake.\\', \\'She trusts me.\\', \\'If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.\\', \"But it doesn\\'t matter now.\", \\'It was me.\\', \"The people who live there, they\\'re not your enemies. They\\'re innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.\", \"They\\'re afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can\\'t expect them to be heroes. They\\'re hostages.\", \\'What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.\\', \\'I beg you, my queen-\\', \"Cersei\\'s followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.\", \\'She wants to attack now.\\', \"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You\\'re the greatest smuggler alive, aren\\'t you?\", \\'I drink to eat the skull keeper.\\', \\'I want to eat the skull keeper.\\', \\'I want to see the ...\\', \\'Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.\\', \\'Ordered by whom? The queen herself?\\', \\'Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.\\', \\'How did they find you?\\', \\'Did you consider taking it off?\\', \"And you\\'re going back to her, to die with her.\", \"She\\'s going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.\", \\'Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.\\', \\'You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.\\', \"She won\\'t. Her enemy\\'s forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.\", \\'The city will fall tomorrow.\\', \\'I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.\\', \\'Why?\\', \"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they\\'ll go. You\\'ll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you\\'ll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.\", \"There won\\'t be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll never see Cersei again.\", \\'Swear to me.\\', \"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King\\'s Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.\", \"I never thought I\\'d get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.\", \"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she\\'ll show mercy to the person who made that possible.\", \"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren\\'t for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.\", \"You were the only one who didn\\'t treat me like a monster. You were all I had.\", \"If you hear the bells ring, they\\'ve surrendered. Call off your men.\", \"I\\'ll find you later.\", \"I\\'m going alone.\", \\'I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.\\', \\'Did you bring any wine?\\', \\'Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn\\\\\\'t keep prisoners for long. I suppose there\\\\\\'s a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys\\\\\\'s ashes can tell my ashes, \"See, I told you.\" It just occurred to me. I\\\\\\'m talking to the only man alive who knows where I\\\\\\'m going.\\', \\'So is there life after death?\\', \\'I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.\\', \"I did. And I\\'d do it again, now that I\\'ve seen what I\\'ve seen. I chose my fate. The people of King\\'s Landing did not.\", \"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who\\'s done fighting?\", \"She liberated the people of Slaver\\'s Bay. She liberated the people of King\\'s Landing. And she\\'ll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.\", \"Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen\\'s nature is fire and blood.\", \"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won\\'t be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.\", \\'The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.\\', \\'And she burned down a city for it.\\', \\'Would you have done it?\\', \"You\\'ve been up there, on a dragon\\'s back. You\\'ve had that power. Would you have burned the city down?\", \"Yes, you do. You won\\'t say because you don\\'t want to betray her but you know.\", \"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I\\'m sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.\", \"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn\\'t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?\", \\'I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.\\', \\'You just came up with that?\\', \"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you\\'ve always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you\\'ve tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?\", \"It\\'s a terrible thing I\\'m asking. It\\'s also the right thing. Do you think I\\'m the last man she\\'ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?\", \\'And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?\\', \"Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn\\'t want Dany to be queen.\", \\'No. But you do. And you have to choose now.\\', \"It\\'s not for you to decide.\", \"You\\'re right. And no one\\'s any better for it. But it\\'s not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.\", \"You\\'re the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.\", \\'Me? The Imp?\\', \\'Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.\\', \"Can\\'t think of a worse choice.\", \"I\\'ve had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we\\'ve made.\", \"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There\\'s nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he\\'d never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?\", \\'Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.\\', \\'From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.\\', \"I know you don\\'t want it. I know you don\\'t care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?\", \\'To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.\\', \\'All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\\', \"N- No, Your Grace, I don\\'t want it.\", \"I don\\'t deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn\\'t. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn\\'t. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.\", \"Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night\\'s Watch.\", \\'The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.\\', \"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it\\'s a good compromise, I suppose.\", \\'What we did.\\', \\'Ask me again in ten years.\\', \"I wouldn\\'t be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.\", \"That\\'s not- Uh-\", \"What\\'s this?\", \\'I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.\\', \"Oh, he\\'s kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed.\", \"He\\'s not kind?\", \\'He what? What does he say about me?\\', \\'Your Grace.\\', \\'Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.\\', \\'As you wish, Your Grace.\\', \\'We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.\\', \\'That will improve.\\', \"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown\\'s debt to you has been paid?\", \\'Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?\\', \\'Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.\\', \\'Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.\\', \\'Find the best builders and set them to the task.\\', \\'I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.\\']'"
